# Basic Concepts Of Fixed Income- *Hints* And *Results*

This Jupyter book includes hints and expected results for each chapter. Each chapter has two sections referring to a notebook: either *Hints* or *Results*.



**Interacting with Jupyter Notebooks**

The Jupyter notebooks can be viewed just as you are viewing this page. The notebooks, however, offers deeper interactive capabilities.  When you navigate to a noebook the upper-right corner of the viewing area shows icons for launching and downloading the notebook.  Downloading needs no elaboration.  The launch icon offers three options:

* **Binder:**
    * Launches in a new browser tab, typically within a minute. 
    * Supports up to one hundred simultaneous users.
    * Functions like any other Jupyter notebook, but runs remotely.
    * Allows you to:
        * Execute existing cells.
        * Add or modify cells.
        * Download the notebook.
    * Note: In this mode the notebook will not be available if saved. 

* **Colab:**
    * Offers the quickest and easiest access without requiring Binder.
        * A Google Drive is not necessary for launching.
        * You can download the notebook without signing into a Google account.
    * Note: You must sign in to a Google account to execute cells or make a copy.
      

* **Live Code:**
    * Requires a Binder launch and is ideal for demonstrations.
    * Enables you to:
        * Run code in existing cells.
        * Alter code in existing cells.
    * Note: You cannot add cells or save results in this mode.

**Any code cell in a notebook or code block in a text cell can be copied to the clipboard by moving your cursor to upper-right corner of the code cell or code block.**
