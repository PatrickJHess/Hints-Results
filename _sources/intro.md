# Basic Concepts Of Fixed Income- *Hints* And *Results*

This Jupyter book includes hints and expected results for each chapter. Each chapter has two sections referring to a notebook: *Hints* and *Results*.

Beyond simply viewing the notebooks, there are several ways to interact with them:

*  ***Download:*** Each notebook can be downloaded individually.

*  ***Copy Code Cells:*** Code cells can be copied by hovering the cursor over the upper-right corner.
*  ***Launch Options:*** Clicking the launch icon provides three choices:

   *    **Binder:** Opens the notebook in a new browser tab. Binder launches in under a minute. The current version of Binder used by Financial Python has a limit of 100 simultaneous users.
   *    **Colab:** This option launches a Colab version of the notebook, bypassing the need for Binder.
   *    **Live Code:** This option allows users to run any code cell directly within the notebook after it launches (Binder must launch).
